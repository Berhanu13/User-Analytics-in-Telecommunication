    ## User Analytics in the Telecommunication Industry
    > The investor, who's good at finding valuable deals, wants to check out TellCo, a mobile company in Pefkakia. I am diving into TellCo's data to see if it's a good buy or not. I am focusing on the info the company's machines automatically collect. The goal is to find chances for growth and figure out if it's a smart move to buy or sell TellCo. I am going to use what I learn from a bunch of telecom data to make decisions that fit the changing telecom world. This report keeps it simple while I dig into the numbers to see what makes sense for the investor.
    ## Data
    > For this project, I used data from a monthly aggregation of xDR records. I obtained a data dump, which was then loaded into a Postgres database. The dataset comprises 55 columns and 15,001 rows.
